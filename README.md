# YoWindow Weather For Window

YoWindow Weather is a creative weather app designed to make weather forecasting simple and enjoyable. Instead of charts and long reports, it uses animated landscapes that reflect the current weather and time. If it's raining outside, you'll see rain in the app. If it’s sunset, the sky will change colors just like it does in real life.

- Realistic Animated Landscapes
Each landscape in YoWindow reflects the actual weather conditions. Snow, rain, sunshine, fog—everything updates in real time. The animations also change with the seasons and time of day.

- Accurate Forecast Data
YoWindow pulls weather data from trusted sources like METAR, National Weather Service, and other global services. This ensures reliable temperature, precipitation, wind, and forecast information for several days ahead.

- Customizable Views
You can choose from a variety of scenes—villages, farms, cities, and even animated art styles. Users can also upload their own photos and use them as the background.
